## Contents
- **Report (PDF):** Full analysis of the Kaggle competition using systems engineering perspective.
- Workshop 1: https://github.com/DScode27/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection-AD-Systems/blob/main/Workshop/Workshop_1_IEEE_Fraud_Detection.pdf
- **Diagrams:**  
  - Data Flow*: shows the flow of data from raw transactions to fraud detection outcome. 

## Methodology
1. **Competition Overview:** Understanding the dataset, target variable, and constraints.  
2. **Systemic Analysis:** Identification of key system elements, interactions, and boundaries.  
3. **Sensitivity & Complexity:** Analysis of variability factors such as data imbalance, feature engineering, and model design.  
4. **Chaos & Randomness:** Exploration of nonlinear and feedback aspects related to evolving fraud strategies.  
5. **Conclusion:** Key insights on strengths, weaknesses, and real-world implications.
