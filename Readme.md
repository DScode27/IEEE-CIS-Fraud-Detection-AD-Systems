## Methodology
1. **Competition Overview:** Understanding the dataset, target variable, and constraints.  
2. **Systemic Analysis:** Identification of key system elements, interactions, and boundaries.  
3. **Sensitivity & Complexity:** Analysis of variability factors such as data imbalance, feature engineering, and model design.  
4. **Chaos & Randomness:** Exploration of nonlinear and feedback aspects related to evolving fraud strategies.  
5. **Conclusion:** Key insights on strengths, weaknesses, and real-world implications.
